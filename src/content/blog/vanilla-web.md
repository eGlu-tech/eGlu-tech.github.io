# Building Without External Dependencies

The modern web is built on a mountain of dependencies. While libraries and frameworks have their place, there is an immense power in returning to the basics.

## Why Vanilla?

When you build with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and Astro's zero-JS-by-default approach), you gain:

- **Performance:** No heavy runtimes or bloat.
- **Longevity:** Your code won't break when a library version changes.
- **Control:** You understand exactly what every line of your code is doing.

This blog itself is a testament to this philosophy.
