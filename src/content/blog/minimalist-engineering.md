Minimalism in engineering isn't just about doing less. It's about doing only what is necessary, and doing it exceptionally well. 

At eGlu.tech, we believe that complexity is the enemy of reliability. When we strip away the unnecessary, we are left with systems that are easier to understand, maintain, and scale.

## The Core Principles

1. **Clarity over Cleverness:** Code should be readable by a human, not just executable by a machine.
2. **Standardization:** Use the tools that have stood the test of time.
3. **Intentionality:** Every line of code, every pixel, and every architectural decision must have a clear purpose.
