# Development Workflow Mandates

- **Autonomous Commits:** After completing a code change, feature, or refinement, autonomously stage and commit the changes immediately.
- **Commit Messages:** Use clear, concise commit messages following the Conventional Commits specification (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `style:`, `refactor:`).
- **No Approval Required:** Do not wait for explicit user approval to commit if a task or sub-task is complete.
- **Simplified Workflow:** No formal validation (builds/type-checks) is required before committing for this project.
