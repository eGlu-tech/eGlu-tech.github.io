# Development Workflow Mandates

- **Autonomous Commits:** After completing and validating a significant code change, feature, or refinement, autonomously stage and commit the changes.
- **Commit Messages:** Use clear, concise commit messages following the Conventional Commits specification (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `style:`, `refactor:`).
- **Validation:** Always ensure the change is verified (e.g., no syntax errors, layout looks correct) before committing.
- **No Approval Required:** Do not wait for explicit user approval to commit if a task or sub-task is complete and verified.
